        "story_text": "NatureBuff was born from a simple observation during a hiking trip in 2018. Our founder, Max Velinsky, noticed the amount of non-biodegradable waste left behind on trailsâ€”particularly wet wipes and plastic containers from hygiene products.\n\nInspired to make a change, Max began researching sustainable alternatives to conventional hygiene products. He discovered that bamboo-based wipes could provide the same convenience without the environmental impact, and that natural soap bars could eliminate the need for plastic packaging.\n\nAfter two years of development and testing, NatureBuff launched its first products in 2020. Today, we're proud to offer a growing range of sustainable hygiene solutions that help outdoor enthusiasts, travelers, and eco-conscious individuals reduce their environmental footprint without sacrificing cleanliness or convenience."
